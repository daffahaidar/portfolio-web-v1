              Hello, my name is Daffa Haidar Nabil Zufar, currently I am a
              student of the faculty of computer science at Binus University.
              Now I live in Majalengka district, a small town that is currently
              developing. I am the first child of the couple Dedi Yusuf Hidayat
              and Nani Yuhaeni, they are my parents and I have one younger
              brother named Yunizar, he is currently 11 years old and in 5th
              grade. I am an agile person, and I don't give up easily. I like a
              small challenge that doesn't exceed my limits. My dream is to
              become a reliable computer expert, therefore at this time I
              decided to study at Binus University. I also have a Youtube
              channel, but at this time the channel is not operating because I
              want to focus on studying first. Oh yes if you want to see my
              youtube channel please click the button below.

            <p>
              The first education that I took was entering one of the schools in
              my city called SDN Talagakulon I. At that time I was 6 years old,
              there I gained a lot of knowledge from reading, writing,
              arithmetic even at that time I won a story-making competition in
              Sundanese and I got 2nd place. In 2014 I graduated from elementary
              school and continued to MTsN 5 Majalengka.

            <p>
              After graduating from elementary school, I continued to study at
              the junior high school level by studying at MTsN 5 Majalengka, one
              of my favorite schools in my city. There I got various kinds of
              experiences starting to become a leader in my class. I was also
              offered to be the OSIS chairman at that school but I turned it
              down because I wanted to focus on studying for achievement and
              after studying for three years there, I continued to high school,
              namely SMAN 1 Talaga.

              After studying at MTsN 5 Majalengka for three years, I continued
              to study at my favorite high school in my city, SMAN 1 Talaga.
              This is the beginning of my organizational experience, at this
              high school I became the OSIS administrator as well as the
              chairman of the youth red cross for the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019
              periods. This organization brought me and taught me how to
              socialize and mingle with the wider community so that now I am no
              longer awkward when interacting with the public and in the end now
              I am continuing my study at Binus University majoring in computer
              science.

            <p>
              I love playing games but I can manage time to play them. The games
              that I often play are Mobile Legends and other games such as games
              made by Electronic Art and Gameloft. There is one thing that is
              interesting from me, namely, I prefer to play mobile games
              compared to PC games, even though PC games are more realistic in
              graphics, but mobile games are more fun to play.

            <div class="topic">Graphic Design</div>
            <p>
              I really like graphic design, I have experience when I was in high
              school. At that time I was asked to design some school pamphlets
              and also design school sports t-shirts, at that time I was very
              happy because my designs were used by many people. I also master
              several graphic design tools such as Canva, Photoshop, pixellab
              and others.

            <div class="topic">Video Editing</div>
            <p>
              I love editing videos, I usually use video editing software,
              namely Kinemaster, a software that runs on mobile devices. Besides
              that, I can also use software such as Adobe Premiere Pro, but I
              rarely use that software because I am more comfortable editing
              videos with the Kinemaster application.

            <div class="topic">Active on Youtube</div>
            <p>
              Since the first time I got to know youtube, I really liked it from
              the start of the videos circulating on youtube until I created my
              own content on youtube. Since I like graphic design and video
              editing in 2017 yesterday I decided to create my own youtube
              channel because I really liked it until I finally got my first
              1000 subscribers in 2018 and unfortunately this hobby had to be
              hindered by my lectures which made me rarely upload anymore
              content.

            <p>
              Apart from graphic design and video editing, I also love to design
              UI and UX. I once redesigned an operating system belonging to vivo
              mobile called Funtouch OS. There I once changed Vivo's Funtouch
              which looks like Android to be cooler by changing the UI to be
              like Samsung's One UI OS, Xiaomi's MiUI OS, Oppo's ColorOS OS,
              even I can make vivo's android look like iOS.

              I also like to play football, I have an idol that is Lionel Messi
              from Argentina and I like the football club FC Barcelona. Every
              time there is an FC Barcelona football match, I always watch it. I
              also have some Barcelona jerseys that I always wear when I'm
              working out. I often play football in my area with my friends and
              also at school when there are physical education lessons.
